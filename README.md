# EDD
Epoch wise double descent based on paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12006

These are the results of a project we did in ML2 course (097209) at the 'The Technion â€“ Israel Institute of Technology'.


## Main results:
#### 1. Practical : remove EDD by PCA
* Based on Running Resnet18 on CIFAR10 
* code based on https://github.com/mohammadpz/Epoch_wise_Double_Descent
* In contrast to above, we took a subset of categories and preformed PCA to remove EDD which above showed. 

#### 2. Therotical : remove EDD by replacing last layer weights with theoretical converged
* We implemented the second method mentioned in the paper using a synthetic dataset. 
* This method was supposed to eliminate the double descent by replacing the weights of the last layer with converged weights, and continue training. 
* We show that for a specific input, it indeed eliminated the double descent, but these results vary from run to run, where for some runs there is no convergence at all (not show here).
